# Release notes

The checked-in [Key.xcodeproj](../Key.xcodeproj) is the project source of truth.

Apple-side identifiers, profiles, and notarization prerequisites are documented in:

- [apple-setup.md](apple-setup.md)

## Build the project

```bash
just build-debug
```

This builds the checked-in [Key.xcodeproj](../Key.xcodeproj) and leaves the app in Xcode's default DerivedData location under `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/...`.

For a signed archive that can exercise the entitled keychain path:

```bash
just build-release-archive
```

The release archive script archives the checked-in [Key.xcodeproj](../Key.xcodeproj) with the signing identities and provisioning profiles already recorded in the project and writes the archive under `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/<date>/`.
Debug builds remain automatic or unsigned for local iteration.
The bundled CLI now lives at `Key.app/Contents/MacOS/key`, the LaunchAgent helper app lives at `Key.app/Contents/Helpers/Key Agent.app`, and the LaunchAgent plist lives at `Key.app/Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/work.tvr.key.agent.plist`.

The release commands are:

```bash
just release <tag>
just bump-version <tag>
just build-release <tag>
just publish-release <tag> <zip-path>
just publish-homebrew <tag>
```

Use tags and release names like `v0.1.0`, `v0.1.1`, or `v0.2.0-alpha.1`.
Accepted tags are strict v-prefixed Semantic Versions in one of these forms:
`vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N`, `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, or `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`. Numeric
identifiers cannot have leading zeroes.
Stable tags build `Key.app` and `key`. Numbered `alpha`, `beta`, and `rc`
tags build the isolated `Key Preview.app` and `key-preview` product and publish
it as a GitHub prerelease automatically. The tag is the only release selector;
the operator does not choose the product separately.
The release tag includes the leading `v`; the app and CLI marketing version do not.
The historical version 3 prerelease checkpoints and their security boundaries
are tracked in
[v3-vault-implementation.md](v3-vault-implementation.md#alpha-release-checkpoints).

Following [Homebrew's alternative release channel convention](https://docs.brew.sh/Cask-Cookbook#casks-for-alternative-release-channels),
prereleases use separate, opt-in casks. Stable tags update `key`, while numbered
prereleases update `key@alpha`, `key@beta`, or `key@rc`. The stable cask installs
`Key.app` and `key`; prerelease casks install `Key Preview.app` and
`key-preview`. This keeps an ordinary `brew upgrade` from moving a stable
installation onto a prerelease while allowing Stable and Preview to coexist. A
tester can opt into a numbered prerelease channel, for example:

```bash
brew install --cask tvanreenen/tap/key@alpha
```

The prerelease casks are mutually exclusive because alpha, beta, and rc all
install the same Preview app and CLI. Switch prerelease channels by uninstalling
the currently installed prerelease cask first. Stable `key` does not conflict
with these casks because it installs a different app and CLI.

Alpha releases through `v0.2.0-alpha.6` used the Mainstream `Key.app` identity.
Before installing the first side-by-side Preview alpha, remove that older cask
installation and reinstall the channel:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask tvanreenen/tap/key@alpha
brew install --cask tvanreenen/tap/key@alpha
```

## What the release workflow guarantees

The tag makes the product decision once. A stable tag selects `Key.app`, `key`,
and the `key` cask. A numbered alpha, beta, or release-candidate tag selects
`Key Preview.app`, `key-preview`, and the matching opt-in cask. The later stages
all use that same decision; there is no independent product switch to mistype.

The version bump creates an ordinary commit on `main`, but not a tag. The build
must then produce a ZIP containing the signed, notarized, and stapled app. The
final gate extracts that ZIP and verifies its exact layout, product identity,
marketing and build versions, Developer ID signatures, hardened runtime, and
entitlement allowlists. Publication will run the same gate again.

Only after the ZIP passes does publication create the annotated tag. It pushes
`main` and the tag atomically, so GitHub receives both or neither. The GitHub
release contains exactly the ZIP and a deterministic `checksums.txt`. A retry
uploads only a missing asset, accepts an exact published asset, and refuses to
replace different bytes or tolerate another asset. This matches GitHub's
[immutable release model](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/immutable-releases).

`just release <tag>` stops after source release publication. Homebrew is a
separate manual checkpoint. `just publish-homebrew <tag>` uses the operator's
existing `gh` login to dispatch only
`tvanreenen/homebrew-tap/.github/workflows/publish-package.yml` on `main` with
`package=key` and the version. Key does not clone, edit, commit, or push the tap,
and it stores no cross-repository credential. The tap verifies the published
release and checksum, renders the cask, runs Homebrew checks, and owns its pull
request.

`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` is an internal Apple/Xcode build counter and advances
with every version bump. The semver or prerelease string is the public version.

## Operator runbook

Use the staged flow for prereleases and any release you intend to inspect one
step at a time. `just release <tag>` runs steps 1 through 3. Step 4 always
requires a separate command.

### 1. Prepare the version commit

Start from clean, current `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git status --short
just bump-version vX.Y.Z[-channel.N]
```

Review the resulting commit. At this point no release tag or remote release
state exists.

### 2. Build the final artifact

```bash
just build-release vX.Y.Z[-channel.N]
```

The command prints the selected product, final ZIP path, and SHA-256. Do not
publish if its final extracted-artifact verification fails.

### 3. Publish GitHub state atomically

```bash
just publish-release vX.Y.Z[-channel.N] <zip-path>
```

This rechecks the ZIP, creates the tag at the version commit, atomically pushes
`main` and the tag, and creates or resumes the GitHub release. Keep `main` at
that commit until the GitHub release upload completes. The supported release
assets are the channel-specific ZIP and `checksums.txt`; the tap resolves both
from the published tag.

### 4. Dispatch the Homebrew update

```bash
just publish-homebrew vX.Y.Z[-channel.N]
```

The command validates the same release tag, dispatches the tap workflow on
`main`, and prints the repository, workflow, package, version, and resolved cask.
It does not wait for the run. Follow the printed `gh run list` command, then
review the pull request created by the tap. Stable updates target `key.rb`;
prereleases target `key@alpha.rb`, `key@beta.rb`, or `key@rc.rb`.

### 5. Smoke-test the distributed product

For an alpha Preview release:

```bash
brew update
brew install --cask tvanreenen/tap/key@alpha   # first installation
brew upgrade --cask tvanreenen/tap/key@alpha   # later alpha releases
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose "/Applications/Key Preview.app"
open -a "Key Preview"
key-preview version --json
key-preview status
```

Run the appropriate Homebrew install or upgrade command, not both.

For a stable release, use the `key` cask, `/Applications/Key.app`, and the `key`
CLI instead. Open the installed app once if the helper has not previously been
registered. Preview has its own configuration, vault default, helper, and
Keychain namespace, so this smoke test does not require repointing Stable Key
at a test vault.

## Failure and retry boundaries

- If the build fails, fix the cause and rerun `just build-release <tag>`; no tag
  or GitHub release exists yet.
- If the atomic Git push reports failure, `main` and the tag cannot have
  advanced independently, but a lost network response can leave the client
  unsure whether both advanced. Fetch or inspect the remote `main` and tag,
  keep the local checkout on the version commit, and rerun publication. The
  retry safely handles either outcome.
- If GitHub release creation or upload fails after the atomic push, immediately
  rerun the same `just publish-release` command from the unchanged version
  commit with the same ZIP. It resumes missing uploads and verifies exact
  existing assets. If an existing asset differs or the release contains an
  unexpected asset, do not replace or delete it; publish a corrected build under
  a new version.
- If dispatch fails before a run is created, fix the operator's `gh` access and
  rerun `just publish-homebrew <tag>`.
- If the tap workflow or pull request fails, the GitHub release remains valid.
  Fix the tap-side problem and rerun `just publish-homebrew <tag>` without
  rebuilding or retagging. An already-current tap update succeeds without a new
  pull request.
- Do not change a published tag or reuse a version number. Correct a released
  artifact with a new version and build number.

This project currently publishes its cask through:

- [tvanreenen/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/tvanreenen/homebrew-tap)

No local tap checkout or cross-repository Actions credential is required.

## Test zsh completion locally

Use an isolated shell so the completion path and `compinit` order are unambiguous:

```zsh
zsh -f
autoload -Uz compinit
fpath=(/Users/tim.vanreenen/Code/key/completions $fpath)
compinit -i
```

The `fpath` update must happen before `compinit`.
If you change the completion file and want to reload it in the same shell, rerun `compinit -i`.

To test dynamic entry completion against a fake vault:

```zsh
mkdir -p /tmp/keycomp/github /tmp/keycomp/personal
touch /tmp/keycomp/github/personal.secret
touch /tmp/keycomp/personal/gmail.secret
zstyle ':completion:*:*:key:*' vault-root /tmp/keycomp
```

Then verify:

```zsh
key <TAB><TAB>
key get <TAB><TAB>
key edit <TAB><TAB>
key copy <TAB><TAB>
```

Expected behavior:

- `key <TAB><TAB>` offers `get`, `copy`, `add`, `edit`, `duplicate`, `rename`, `remove`, `list`, `unlock`, `lock`, `version`, and `help`
- `key get <TAB><TAB>` offers `github/personal` and `personal/gmail`

## Verify signing inputs

```bash
just verify-signing "$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/<date>/<archive>.xcarchive/Products/Applications/Key.app"
```

Use `just verify-release ...` after notarization and stapling if you want the full Gatekeeper check as well.

## Notarize and staple

`just build-release <tag>` uses the `key-notary` `notarytool` keychain profile directly.
See [apple-setup.md](apple-setup.md) for the one-time `notarytool store-credentials` command and where to create the Apple app-specific password.
